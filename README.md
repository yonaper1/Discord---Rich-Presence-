This Is The Disocrd - Rich Presence

Hi So this is my first upload here so im pretty new 

okay 

So in the "discord.lua" you have to change the SetDiscordAppId(640944828502245376) <------- The Numbers Here 

Second Thing you need to do is changeing the the names of the photos to ur photo name SetDiscordRichPresenceAsset("change to your photo name")

and the last is to start it in the config
